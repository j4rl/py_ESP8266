# The Node MCU ESP8266
The Node MCU ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller with a full TCP/IP stack and a microcontroller unit (MCU) based on the Node MCU architecture. The Node MCU ESP8266 is a popular choice for IoT projects because of its low cost, ease of use, and built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. The Node MCU ESP8266 can be programmed using a variety of programming languages, including MicroPython, Lua, and Arduino C++. In this repository, we will be using MicroPython to program the Node MCU ESP8266.
## Pinout
The Node MCU ESP8266 has a total of 30 pins, which are divided into two rows of 15 pins each. The pins are labeled from D0 to D8, and from A0 to A0. The Node MCU ESP8266 also has a built-in LED on pin D0, which can be used for debugging purposes. The pinout of the Node MCU ESP8266 is shown below:
